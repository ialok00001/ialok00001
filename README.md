I am a Data Scientist, currently working at <a href="https://www.kantar.com/">Kantar</a>, Chennai. I did my MSc in Data Science, as well as my Bachelors' in Mathematics and Physics at <a href="https://www.cmi.ac.in">Chennai Mathematical Institute</a>.
<br><br>
My key interests include different topics in **Artificial Intelligence**, such as **Machine Leaning**, **Deep Learning**, **Reinforcement Learning**, **Generative AI and Foundation models**, **Computer Vision**, **Natural Language Processing**, **Bayesian Statistics**, etc. With this fast growing pace in AI, I try to keep myself familiar with as many topics and recent research as possible. Even in my free time, I either spend it by familiarizing myself with topics in AI, or engaging in my other hobbies.
<br><br>
Apart from office works, I spend most of my time working on independent projects and conducting experiments. This could include testing out new ideas, research paper, or even combining different papers. In my `side quests`, I try to replicate results from various topics which come by my sight either through papers, blogs, youtube videos, or even someone's claim.
<br><br>
Do check out my projects and blogs if you get time. Also, you can connect with me for project collaborations, or for just saying HI. I am always (trying to be) available on Linkedin.
