I am an MSc Data Science student at <a href="https://www.cmi.ac.in">Chennai Mathematical Institute</a>. I‚Äôm mostly interested in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Deep Leaning** and want to contribute to the world to bring a technological balance between humans and machines.<br><br>I completed my bachelor's in Mathematics and Physics (Honours) from the same college. At the end of my $5^{th}$ semester, I realized that I wanted to dive into a subject that includes both mathematics, science, and technology, and Data Science seemed to be the closest subject to fit these criteria. Looking further into this field, I found it very interesting and kept dwelling further the more I learned about its concepts and ingenious ideas. At the end of my $6^{th}$ semester, I decided to take it as a subject for further studies and want to do something big and innovative related to this in the future. Now, I have realized that it is not a one-step process but rather a long journey, which requires dedication and persistence. Also, it is the journey that is more important than the goal itself.<br><br>Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in various fields of AI and working on independent projects that could help the community. Do reach out to me if you want to collaborate with me on some interesting project or any new idea.<br></br> P.S. I always respond to LinkedIn messages.
